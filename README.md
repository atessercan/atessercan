# Hi there!

- I am a  **frontend developer**  from Turkey. I like building user interfaces for the Web.

- **ReactJS**  world is the super enjoyable realm and currently I am learning **NextJS** framework.

- In my daily routine, I mostly use `.js{x}`, `.ts{x}`, `.{s}css`, `.html` , `.sh` and the minors.

- That's all. Have a nice commit!
